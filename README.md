# Hacking the Building Code
A Guide for people looking to Make creative space.
# Intro
All the various codes that apply to a building are confusing to even trained professionals in the industry. So it’s incredibly difficult for someone who’s never navigated these waters before. However, there are some easy-to-learn overarching rules that I’ll explain in this guide. My hope is that you’ll learn enough here to be able to complete your own research of what you need to do to meet Code. Because every situation is going to be different and very specific to your needs, location, neighborhood, and city. Empowered with a basic understanding, you’ll be able to ask the right questions, get the right information, and get a better grasp on how the various codes apply to your efforts as a Maker. 
# Why do we even need codes?
So you might say to yourself ‘why do we need all these rules? I’m safe and smart and sane!’. Well it’s because no matter how safe you might be, your neighbor might not be, so we have to have rules. These regulations are really focused on the health and safety of the community and have grown and changed as our understanding of safety has changed. They are a good idea, they save lives, and shouldn’t be broken. And if you’re not a building professional it is very possible that you don’t fully understand the risks you might be taking in what you’re doing. The tragic Ghostship fire in Oakland shows that these rules are meant to protect far more than just the few people who may be making the (sometimes terrible) decisions of how to use a building. Yes, there are too many rules, and sometimes they conflict, but at their core they are here to help. Arguing that there should be less of them is pointless to actually getting anything done, so let’s get on with it!
# Which codes and where to find them
City and Planning / Zoning Codes vary by County and City. You can usually find them online from your local City’s website. They are not standardized at all, and even the way they are organized, the terms they use, and the way they cover things can be wildly different from county to county or city to city. Here in the Bay Area, for example, San Francisco, Berkeley, and Oakland’s City Codes and Planning Codes are all completely and utterly different.
Building & Fire Codes vary by State, but are all based upon the International Building Code. Sadly due to copyright issues, they probably aren’t listed on your State’s government website. However, It’s very likely that your local Building Codes can be found here instead: https://law.resource.org/pub/us/code/safety.html. If so, please send Carl some money to his non-profit, because he’s fighting the good fight, is a great guy, and needs all the help he can get.
Industry Standards, such as OSHA, NFPA, UL, and others can be very hard to find for free. Again, https://public.resource.org/ may have them, but if they don’t, the City may have a copy you can review for free. Some of these standards can cost a lot of money! Sadly, the above codes may reference these closed, non-public ones, such as the Building Code saying that Fire Sprinklers have to meet certain standards in the NFPA.
Lastly, always check what Codes will apply to your building. Sometimes Cities don’t adopt certain sections of codes. If you’re on federal land or in a historic building it’s possible you don’t have to follow certain codes. Certain uses can make other codes apply, such as serving food prompting you to meet health codes. And sometimes there can be additional codes just due to the location of the building because of it being next to a shoreline, national forest, or other existing feature. The best way to do this is to hire a professional, the next best way is to go to the City and talk to the Planning, Building, Business Development, and Fire departments and ask plainly ‘what other codes could apply to my building?’. 
# How to talk to Officials
All of these departments are made of people. “The City’ is not a monolithic all-knowing force out to stop you from doing what you want. It’s just a bunch of people. People you probably have far more in common with than you may realize. Just like Makers, they are into details, ideas, and love seeing things get built. They actually want to work with you, but only if they can see what you’re doing is safe, legal, and good for the community. And if you’re not a jerk. Bring them something they might not have seen before, like a Makerspace, and you’ve got some work to do to help them understand what it is. So getting upset, or approaching them as if you are smarter than they are, or thinking you can debate your way into being ‘right’ doesn’t really help. What does help is being nice, friendly, listening to what they have to say, and trying to connect with and understand where they are coming from first. Only then can you really try to explain what you’re trying to do, and help them clearly understand how they might help you do that. And if they are wrong, which does happen, don’t be a jerk about it. Instead try to find common ground, and explain nicely and calmly your case for why you think you are right, not why they are wrong. You’re not trying to ‘win’ you’re trying to work together.
These	people are passionate about what they do. As an example, the Fire Marshal has spent their whole life working on fire safety. They typically are a firefighter who worked their way up into this senior role over many years. They are huge fire safety nerds. And as a Maker, you can identify with being a huge nerd about something most people may not pay too much attention to. The Fire Marshal not only cares deeply about fire safety, all their friends also tend to be firefighters. Firefighters that might be put at risk by the stupid thing you may be doing. It’s quite likely the Fire Marshal has lost good friends who died trying to save people who were doing stupid things. So have some respect for their knowledge and passion for the subject, and if they think you are doing something stupid you should listen, apologize, and ask them to help you not be stupid. They may seem upset all the time, but they are upset because they really do care. Don’t take it personally. Ask them what they think about your extinguisher layouts, ask them what brand of smoke detectors they like, and try and take advantage of their deep knowledge. They would love nothing more than to talk fire safety with you for hours. And the same goes for many building officials. Try to tap into their passion, for most officials actually want to help.
It’s inherently opaque and disorganized. Get over it and on with it. Any bureaucracy is inherently anti-democratic, because if you don’t know how to approach it, you can’t get anything done. And any given building is overseen by many different agencies. Agencies that not only don’t talk to each other, they aren’t even aware of each other's rules much of the time. And sometimes those rules will conflict. So it’s entirely on you to do the legwork, keep great notes, do your research, reach out to the City, get everything in writing if you can, and always ask every building official you talk to “who else should I speak with about this?”. Yes, it stinks that it’s this way. Complaining about it doesn’t help. There is a reason professionals can make a living just helping others navigate these waters. It’s complex. Also most building professionals, like architects and engineers, would probably love to help you out for cheap or free if you’re doing something cool and good for the community. So don’t complain, put in the legwork, and get help if you can.
Know your rights. And your lack of! For example, a Fire Marshal can enter any space they deem needs to be inspected for fire safety. They don’t need a warrant. Asking them for one will only convince them that you’re possibly an idiot who’d doing something stupid they need to catch. However, if a building official says you can’t do something, or a neighbor raises a ruckus, but the law and codes are on your side, then it’s a good thing for you to know that. The more you can learn here the better. Look at this just like any other Maker project, just like with electronic hacking there are rules, but there are also creative solutions, and a whole world of things that someone once said couldn’t be done.
# Use
‘Use’ is the pivot upon which all the rest of these codes turn. Every building has what’s called a Certificate of Occupancy on file at the City. This is the officially listed Use for the building, which in turn defines what standards it has to meet.
It goes like this. The City Laws define if a Use is even allowed in the city, and what permits and requirements you may need for that use in some cases. Like if you can even have welding in your space without a special permit, what sorts of events you can hold in your building, and what hours your business can be open. The Planning / Zoning Department gets to say where certain Uses are allowed in general, so that a loud industrial space doesn’t get to be in the middle of a quiet residential area. The Building Department gets to say how a building gets built based on it’s Use. And the Fire Department gets to say what your space needs to operate safely for it’s Use.
These are the main four authorities a Maker is going to interface with when it comes to making certain their space is legal for their Use. There are more, however, you may need to work with depending on your Use. A cafe within a Makerspace might also need the Health Department to review it, or a educational space might have someone from the local schools in charge of it. So what the Use of the space is can be a very big deal, as is changing the use (much more on that below!). 
# Changing Use
What’s critically important to understand is if you change the Use of a building, legally you are supposed to apply for a change to the Certificate of Occupancy. And in order to get that you need to most likely change the building itself to meet the new standards that new use requires. This even applies to spaces within a building, which while maybe not needing a change to the Certificate of Occupancy, still would be required to meet the new standards the new Use brings. 
So, for example, a warehouse meant for making stuff in (and not just storage) is probably listed as a ‘F-1 Light Industrial Use’ on it’s Certificate of Occupancy at the City. In order to legally be built in the first place, it had to meet the standards of a building of that use in that location. That means a certain number of exits, a certain level of fire-resistance in it’s construction, a certain number of bathroom and parking spots, and other rules it had to follow. Possibly limits, too, imposed by the zoning code or city law about that use as well, such as how big it can be, when it can be open, how much noise it can make, or what forms of pollution it can produce.

Now let’s say someone rents or buys this particular warehouse with the intention of using it as an event space. That is what’s called a ‘Change of Use’. Event spaces have different, more strict standards that have to be met because there will be way more people in an event space than in a warehouse. So now that warehouse, which was legal before, does not meet those new standards, and is not legal for that use. If you were to go down to the City and apply for a new Certificate of Occupancy to change the building into a legal event space, they would refuse until you got the building up to the new standards that use requires. Unless the building is renovated to meet the new building and fire code standards for an event space, such as adding exits, fire wall separations, exit signage, lighting, fire sprinklers, etc. it can’t legally be used as an event space. Also, the Planning Code may not allow for that use in the area the building is in, for they deem it to be a traffic problem or a disruption to the neighbors of that area. Finally, the city itself may have additional local laws that require you to get special permits for certain kinds of events, or certain sized events, or not allow you to serve booze or even coffee without special licences.

So changing the use of a building is actually a big deal. It ‘triggers’ all sorts of required upgrades and modifications to be legal. And sadly, it’s far too easy to do, and something Makers can stumble into without meaning to. 

Because this also applies to spaces within a building. So with our warehouse example above, let’s say that only part of the building is going to be for events, and most of it is going to be for Making. Well as long as that event space isn’t more than a certain percentage of the overall space, you wouldn’t need to get a new Certificate of Occupancy. But you would need to make the event space part meet the more strict codes it requires, and in some cases completely separate it from the rest of the inside of your building depending on what the fire separation rules state for that kind of building.

For example, your friendly small CO-OP Hackerspace / Coworking / Cafe that’s rented a storefront retail space somewhere is suddenly gifted a used pick-and-place line complete with silk-screening station and board oven. Awesome! You’ve got a empty back room where it could go, and the smarts to set it up and start cranking out boards for you and your friends. Coffee and circuit boards! What else goes better together? 

Except that the space you’re in isn’t on file for making circuit boards as it’s use, your city doesn’t allow anything like that anywhere near food, your local zoning doesn’t allow manufacturing in this neighborhood, the only room you’ve got to put it in isn’t fire rated and doesn’t have the right ventilation, and you didn’t change out the fire extinguishers in that room and don’t have good exits and emergency shut-offs. So by accepting that used tool, and locating it in that back room, you’ve just inadvertently changed the Use of that space, and now you’ve got troubles you won’t be aware of until you possibly get in big trouble.

So the best thing is to find a space in the first place that already supports the sorts of things you’d like to do, even if it may not be the ideal location. If you want to be industrial for example, then go find industrial space, and compromise on your location. The next best thing is to be aware of the issues that arise when changing the use of a space, and to take steps to make that use legal. So putting a Makerspace into your local school’s unused storage space? That’s awesome, but check about fire sprinklers and exits first. The hardest thing to do is change the use of an entire building, and it’s not to be taken on lightly. So no matter how cool and cheap to rent that old church might be, it’s going to make a terrible Makerspace without way more work than you might be thinking.
Violations
Ironically, while Use flows down from the City to the Fire Department, in terms of a renter or building owner’s concerns regarding legality and getting in trouble, it flows the other way. In other words, violations of fire code are severely punished, fire inspectors are supposed to do regular surveys of buildings, and the fire marshal has a huge amount of power and special rights. As in the Fire Marshall can haul you personally off to jail, and only answers to the State Fire Marshall. Building Code violations, on the other hand, are only found when reported by someone, and typically lead to fines until the issues are addressed unless things are so bad a building is outright condemned. Zoning violations, while obviously bad and illegal, also are only found unless reported, and again, mostly result in fines. And the City might never get around to actually following up on things. So while it’s a terrible idea to not follow any of these codes, if you are not legal and limited in what you’re able to do, start with Fire, and then Building, and then Zoning, and then the City.

And in some cases, when someone is doing something that isn’t really allowed, but is a really great idea, and everything else is legal and up to code, sometimes the Powers That Be will allow that Use to continue if it’s deemed a good thing for the community, and allow what’s called a Variance or in some special cases even revise the Codes to allow it. Variances are special permissions given as a one-time case to allow for you to not have to follow some specific section of code, or to follow a different set of standards instead. For example, you could get a Variance from Zoning to allow you to use what was a shipping / receiving area in an office building as a prototyping shop, even though manufacturing isn’t allowed in that neighborhood. Variances can take a very long time, and lots of expensive professionals to obtain, so don’t rely on them as a given to fix a situation. In our example here, you may have to go before a Planning board (that only meets a few times a year) and make your case to get the Variance, arguing (and showing via plans and pictures) that the Use is both safe and good for the community.

A great recent example of a City changing the Codes to support something new and good is what happened with the urban farming movement in Oakland. Some people rented some defunct and almost-abandoned lots in a forgotten corner of an industrial area of Oakland, and turned it into an awesome urban farm. They followed all the rules they knew of in regards to farming, but it turns out ‘farming’ wasn’t an allowed Use within Oakland. But everyone thought it was a great idea. So the City assigned a planner to work with the urban farming folks and revise the Planning Code to add in the rules needed to cover this sort of creative use, and then helped get the farm to be fully legal. 

So don’t break the law. It’s a terrible idea. But just know that if you break the law without knowing, but are doing something great and doing it in a safe way, you can probably work with the authorities to fix the problem (even revising the rules!) and make everything better for everyone. With our urban farming example, if those folks had been unsafe with lots of Fire Code violations, they would have simply been shut down. YMMV.
Occupancy
Uses are collected together into what’s called an ‘Occupant Code’ or just ‘Occupancy’. So many professional ‘Maker’ uses all get grouped under ‘F-1’ for ‘Light Manufacturing’. So a wood shop, a welding shop, a machine shop, a 3D printing and assembly shop, etc. would all just be an ‘F-1’ Occupancy. This is important, for many rules within the Codes are written in reference to the Occupant Code of a space, and not the more specific Use that may be listed on the Certificate of Occupancy.

The Occupancies Makers care the most about are below, with snippets of code up front and a summary below:
A - Assembly
SECTION  303
ASSEMBLY GROUP A
303.1 Assembly Group A. Assembly Group A occupancy includes, among others, the use of a building or structure, or a portion thereof, for the gathering of persons for purposes such as civic, social or religious functions; recreation, food or drink consumption or awaiting transportation; or motion picture and television production studio soundstages, approved production facilities and production locations.

Everything from a big theater to a conference center to a neighborhood cafe could be classified as an A Occupancy. There are different levels here, A-1 through A-5, for different uses. The rules for these spaces are some of the more strict; with higher standards and requirements for exits, life safety, seismic upgrades, bathrooms, and more. Maker cafes, performances spaces, event spaces, large lecture halls, and community centers all fall into this category.

Pro Tip: There is a special provision that if you limit the number of people in your space to under 50, or the space is less than 750 square feet, then you can count that space as a B occupancy instead of the more strict A. This is why most cafes have a ‘Limit 49 Persons’ sign on the wall!  

If this is the sort of space you want, it’s best to just get one that is already at least close to the same use if not the same use. Or compromise on what sorts of things you’ll use the space for, and hold smaller events. Converting a space over to an Assembly use is expensive, time-consuming, and doesn’t have a lot of bang-for-the-buck. That big cheap warehouse might actually be the worst space to use!
B - Business (office)
SECTION 304
BUSINESS GROUP B
304.1 Business Group B. Business Group B occupancy includes, among others, the use of a building or structure, or a portion thereof, for office, professional or service-type transactions, including storage of records and accounts. Business occupancies shall include, but not be limited to, the following:

Airport traffic control towers
Ambulatory care facilities serving five or fewer patients
Animal hospitals, kennel and pound.
Bank
Barber and beauty shops
Car wash
Civic administration
Clinic, outpatient
Dry cleaning and laundries:  pick-up and delivery locations and self-service
Educational occupancies for students above the 12th grade
Electronic data processing
Laboratories: testing, research and instruction
Motor vehicle showrooms
Post offices
Print shop
Professional services (architects, attorney, dentists, physician, engineer, etc.)
Radio and television stations
Telephone exchange
Training and skill development not within a school or academic program


One of the more straightforward occupancies, any general office space falls under the B Occupancy. I’ve made bold the uses most likely to apply to Makers above. Coworking spaces, Classrooms for adult Maker programs, Maker Businesses that focus more on design/prototyping/research and engineering than hands-on production, and even hackerspaces that lean more towards small electronics or biohacking could fall under this category. Since office buildings are pretty common, the challenge here is more how to safely and legally fit in the more industrial tools Makers tend to want to use within an office-type space. We’ll talk more about that later in this guide.  
F - Manufacturing
SECTION 306
FACTORY GROUP F
306.1 Factory Industrial Group F. Factory Industrial Group F occupancy includes, among others, the use of a building or structure, or a portion thereof, for assembling, disassembling, fabricating, finishing, manufacturing, packaging, repair or processing operations that are not classified as a Group H hazardous or Group S storage occupancy.

306.2 Moderate-hazard factory industrial, Group F-1.
Factory industrial uses which are not classified as Factory Industrial F-2 Low Hazard shall be classified as F-1 Moderate Hazard and shall include, but not be limited to, the following:

Aircraft (manufacturing, not to include repair)
Appliances
Athletic equipment
Automobiles and other motor vehicles
Bakeries
Beverages: over 16-percent alcohol content
Bicycles
Boats
Brooms or brushes
Business machines
Cameras and photo equipment
Canvas or similar fabric
Carpets and rugs (includes cleaning)
Clothing
Construction and agricultural machinery
Disinfectants
Dry cleaning and dyeing
Electric generation plants
Electronics
Engines (including rebuilding)
Food processing and commercial kitchens not associated with restaurants, cafeterias and similar dining facilities
Furniture
Hemp products
Jute products
Laundries
Leather products
Machinery
Metals
Millwork (sash and door)
Motion picture and television production studio
Sound Stages, Approved Production 
Facilities and production locations (without live audiences)
Musical instruments
Optical goods
Paper mills or products
Photographic film
Plastic products
Printing or publishing
Recreational vehicles
Refuse incineration
Shoes
Soaps and detergents
Textiles
Tobacco
Trailers
Upholstering
Wood; distillation
Woodworking (cabinet)


306.3 Low-hazard factory industrial, Group F-2. Factory industrial uses that involve the fabrication or manufacturing of noncombustible materials which during finishing, packing
or processing do not involve a significant fire hazard shall be classified as F-2 occupancies and shall include, but not be limited to, the following:

Beverages: up to and including 16-percent alcohol content
Brick and masonry
Ceramic products
Foundries
Glass products
Gypsum
lce
Metal products (fabrication and assembly)


Simultaneously one of the less strict and more strict occupancies, the F or Factory occupancy is one many spaces Makers work in will fall into. It’s less strict, because they don’t assume many people will be in that space, so things like exits, bathrooms, and lighting can be very minimal. However, due to fire hazards from industrial use, things like requirements for specific fire sprinklers, life safety, proper storage of combustibles, OSHA guidelines, and more can make these spaces complex to be fully legal as well. The shop within a Makerspace, many Maker businesses that do a lot of production, and even a school’s shop class all fall into a F category. As you can see, there are two levels as well, depending on how flammable the kind of work is. Note that if a building doesn’t have fire sprinklers, it will probably be rather difficult to change it into an F use if it wasn’t already.  
M - Retail
SECTION 309
MERCANTILE GROUP M
309.1 Mercantile Group M. Mercantile Group M occupancy includes, among others, the use of  a building or structure or a portion thereof, for the display and sale of merchandise and involves stocks of goods, wares or merchandise incidental to such purposes and accessible to the public. Mercantile occupancies shall include, but not be limited to, the following:

Department stores
Drug stores
Markets
Motor fuel-dispensing facilities
Retail or wholesale stores
Sales rooms

309.2 Quantity of hazardous materials. The aggregate quantity of nonflammable solid and nonflammable or noncombustible liquid hazardous materials stored or displayed in a single control area of a Group M occupancy shall not exceed the quantities in Table 414.2.5(1).

A whole retail store to even just the space in the front of your Makerspace where you sell T-shirts could be considered an M type occupancy. It is one of the less strict occupancies, other than they assume you may have many people within it on the sales area. 
R - Residential
SECTION 310
RESIDENTIAL GROUP R
310.1 Residential Group R. Residential Group R includes, among others, the use of a building or structure, or a portion thereof, for sleeping purposes when not classified as an Institutional Group I or when not regulated by the California Residential Code.

310.3 Residential Group R-1 (mostly for hotels, so we’re going to leave this out)

310.4 Residential Group R-2. Residential occupancies containing sleeping units or more than two dwelling units where the occupants are primarily permanent in nature, including:

Apartment houses
Boarding houses (nontransient) with more than 16 occupants
Congregate residences (nontransient) with more than 16 occupants
Convents
Dormitories
Fraternities and sororities
Hotels (nontransient)
Live/work units
Monasteries
Motels (nontransient)
Vacation timeshare properties


310.5 Residential Group R-3. Residential occupancies where the occupants are primarily permanent in nature and not classified as Group R-l,  R-2.1, R-3.1, R-4 or I, including:

Buildings that do not contain more than two dwelling units
Boarding houses (nontransient) with 16 or fewer occupants
Boarding houses (transient) with 10 or fewer occupants
Adult care facilities that provide accommodations for six or fewer clients of any age for less than 24 hours. 


Licensing categories that may use this classification include, but are not limited to:

Adult Day Programs.
Child care facilities that provide accommodations for six or fewer clients of any age for less than 24 hours.
Day-Care Center for Mildly Ill Children,
Infant Care Center,
School Age Child Day-Care Center.
Congregate residences (nontransient) with  16  or fewer occupants
Congregate residences (transient) with  10  or fewer occupants
Efficiency dwelling units
Family Day-Care Homes that provide accommodations for 14 or fewer children, in the provider's own home for less than 24-hours.
Alcoholism or drug abuse recovery homes (ambulatory only)
Foster family homes (ambulatory only)



310.6 Residential Group R-4 (mostly for assisted living facilities, so we’re going to leave this out)

The Residential Occupancy Group is what any sort of living area would fall under. R-2 or R-3 is going to be what 99% of the cases most Makers meet will fall into, but if your Makerspace wants to provide a daycare as well, it’s possible some of these other occupancies may come into play. While it’s not a terribly demanding occupancy, it does have some severe limits as to what other sorts of occupancies it can share space with without requiring fire separations (or possibly no adjoining openings of any kind!). 
S - Storage
SECTION  311
STORAGE GROUP S
311.1 Storage Group S. Storage Group S occupancy includes, among others, the use of a building or structure, or a portion thereof, for storage that is not classified as a hazardous occupancy.

311.2 Moderate-hazard storage, Group S-1.  Buildings occupied for storage uses that are not classified as Group S-2, including, but not limited to, storage of the following:

Aerosols, Levels 2 and 3
Aircraft hangar (storage and repair)
Bags: cloth, burlap and paper
Bamboos and rattan
Baskets
Belting: canvas and leather
Books and paper in rolls or packs
Boots and shoes
Buttons, including cloth covered, pearl or bone
Cardboard and cardboard boxes
Clothing, woolen wearing apparel
Cordage
Dry boat storage (indoor)
Furniture
Furs
Glues, mucilage, pastes and size
Grains
Horns and combs, other than celluloid
Leather

Tobacco, cigars, cigarettes and snuff
Upholstery and mattresses
Wax candles


311.3 Low-hazard storage, Group S-2. Includes, among others, buildings used for the storage of noncombustible materials such as products on wood pallets or in paper cartons with or without single thickness divisions; or in paper wrappings. Such products are permitted to have a negligible
amount of plastic trim, such as knobs, handles or film wrapping. Group S-2 storage uses shall include, but not be limited to, storage of the following:

Asbestos
Beverages up to and including 6-percent alcohol in metal, glass or ceramic containers
Cement in bags
Chalk and crayons
Dairy products in nonwaxed coated paper containers
Dry cell batteries

Metal desks with plastic tops and trim
Metal parts
Metals
Mirrors
Oil-filled and other types  of  distribution transformers
Parking garages, open or enclosed
Porcelain and pottery
Stoves
Talc and soapstones
Washers and dryers


Storage is probably the most forgiving occupancy a Maker will encounter. But it is good to know that storage of some items, like wood, is deemed more hazardous and may require different construction than storage of metals.

Live / Work
SECTION 419
LIVE WORK  UNITS
419.1 General. A live/work unit shall comply with Sections 419.1 through 419.9. 
Exception: Dwelling or sleeping units that include an office that is less than 10 percent of the area of the dwelling unit are permitted to be classified as dwelling units with accessory occupancies in accordance with Section 508.2.

419.1.1 Limitations. The following shall apply to all live/work areas:
The live/work unit is permitted to be not greater than 3,000 square feet (279 m 2 ) in area;
The nonresidential area is permitted to be not more than 50 percent of the area of each live/work unit;
The nonresidential area function shall be limited to the first or main floor only of the live/work unit; and
Not more than five nonresidential workers or employees are allowed to occupy the nonresidential area at anyone time.

419.2 Occupancies. Live/work units shall be classified as a Group R-2 occupancy. Separation requirements found in Sections 420 and 508 shall not apply within the live/work unit where the live/work unit is in compliance with Section 419. Nonresidential uses which would otherwise be classified as either a Group H or S occupancy shall not be permitted in a live/work unit.

Exception: Storage shall be permitted in the live/work unit provided the aggregate area of storage in the nonresidential portion of the live/work unit shall be limited to 10 percent of the space dedicated to nonresidential activities.

419.5 Fire protection. The live/work unit shall be provided with a monitored fire alarm system where required by Section 907.2.9 and an automatic sprinkler system in accordance with Section 903.2.8.

Live / Work is a special case, with lots of rules about it. It’s mostly a mix of R-2 and B or F-1 type occupancies. They have to have fire sprinklers, and have some limits on how much area can be devoted to different uses. However you don’t have to separate those uses with fire walls like you normally would. Usually it has to be a 50/50 or 33/66 mix of living vs. working area. It can’t be all working or all living. Otherwise it follows similar rules of an Mixed Occupancy, listed below.
The Rest
The other codes, like E for education and H for hazard, well, those get more complex and are hard to combine with the above, and unlikely to be encountered by Makers. So we’re not going to get into that in this guide. 
Small Spaces
What about small spaces within your building that have other uses? Like the storage area in your office building? Well you’re allowed a certain percentage of the total area to be for other uses without having to make the whole building that Occupancy too, as long as those spaces follow the rules for that Occupancy. For example, an office building is a B Occupancy. But it has a loading dock / storage area (S-1 occupancy), and a few big meeting rooms (A-3 occupancy). But as they are less than 20% of your building, you just need to meet whatever standards those rooms need, you don't have to meet all the standards an Assembly use would trigger for the entire building. If the building really is mixed up, it's called a Mixed Occupancy.
Mixed Occupancy
When your building is really a somewhat-equal mix of spaces that fall into very different occupancies, it’s going to get complex. This is called a ‘Mixed Occupancy’ and each part of the building is treated as a different Occupancy depending on it’s use, and whichever the ‘strictest’ Occupancy is tends to be what you have to follow in regards to other rules, like area limits, fire separations, construction type, etc.
Occupant Number and Load Factor
So every Use of a space drives something called the Occupant Load Factor. You take the area of the space, you divide it by this factor, and that gives you the number of occupants you have to design the space to be able to accommodate. For example, if you’ve got an office space, the Occupant Load Factor is 100. So if your office is 5,000 square feet, that means the space has to be legal to have up to 50 people using it (5000 / 1000 = 50). Number of required exits, the size of those exits, number of bathrooms, what sort of emergency signage / lighting, and more all are driven by the number of occupants in a space, which is set via the Occupant Load Factor.

<<insert table>>

In some cases you are able to negotiate to either have less people in a space, and thus less strict rules that have to be followed. For example, if you have a space that would typically be a A-3 assembly occupancy, but you limit the number of people allowed in the space to under 50, there’s a special exemption that lets you classify that space as a less-strict B occupancy instead. Hence why you see in many small cafes and bars the sign ‘Max Occupancy 49 people’. By voluntarily limiting the number of people, you can negotiate with building officials and fnd exemptions that make it easier to use a space that way. So even if the Occupant Count from the Occupant Load Factor is over 50, by limiting to under 50 in this case, you don’t have to have a second exit, extra bathrooms, more fire-resistant construction, etc.

Or in some cases you can negotiate to have more people in a space by going the extra mile. Adding extra exits, fire sprinklers when you don’t already need them, more signage, and other extra efforts, when negotiated ahead of time with the building officials, can sometimes get them to allow you to go over what the Occupant Load Factor says a space should be limited to. 

One-time events can usually go way over the allowed number if proper steps are taken as well. Party permits, approvals from the Fire Marshall, trained staff at key locations to help people to an exit in case of an emergency, additional signage, and more can all make it fully legal to have faceway more people within a space for parties, events, conventions, and more.
Construction Types & Fire Ratings
Buildings are classified into ‘Construction Types’ based upon how fire-resistant they are, which is dependent upon what they are generally made out of. There are five main types, denoted for some reason with roman numerals, going from the most fire resistant “Type I” to the least resistant “Type V”. How big of a building or space of a certain Occupancy is allowed is determined by these Types. And in some cases, certain Occupancies aren’t even allowed if the building isn’t a minimum Type. It’s easy to classify most buildings, as you’ll see below with each Types definition.

Additionally, specific parts of the building are ‘Fire Rated’. This is a measure of how long it would take for a fire on one side of something to reach the other side. So, for example, a One Hour Rated wall is made of materials such that a fire of a certain size on one side of the wall would take an hour to reach the other side of the wall. This ‘Fire Rating’ is used for all sorts of construction; walls, floors, ceilings, doors, windows, stairs, and even whole assemblies of these parts. So a ‘Two Hour Rated exit corridor’ is an entire hallway to the exit where all it’s walls, the floor, and the ceiling would hold back a fire for two hours to allow people to safely exit the burning building. Fire Ratings on existing construction are not easy to classify, for they are lab-tested and proven constructions, and have to follow specific building codes exactly (down to nail placements!) in order to work.  
Type I
Type I buildings are the most fire resistant. Nothing flammable can be used for its exterior walls, structure, interior walls / floors / ceilings / etc. In some classifications flammable finishes can be used, but in the most restrictive classification even that isn’t allowed. Examples are skyscrapers, hazardous modern factories, and concrete bunkers. There are two subclasses of Type I buildings, based upon the ratings of their parts. 

Type IA - Protected Non-combustible:
3 hour rated Exterior Walls
3 Hour rated Structural Frame
2 Hour rated Floor/Ceiling Assemblies
1 ½ Hr. Roof Protection

Type IB - Protected Non-combustible:
2 hour rated Exterior Walls
2 hour rated Structural Frame 
2 hour rated Ceiling/Floor Separation 
1 hour rated Ceiling/Roof Assembly 
Type II
Type II buildings are mostly educational and smaller commercial buildings. Again, the exterior walls and frame are non-combustible, and there are two subclasses.
 
Type IIA - Protected Non-combustible:
1 hour rated Exterior Walls 
1 hour rated Structural Frame
1 hour rated Floor/Ceiling/Roof Protection 

Type IIB - Non-combustible:
The building has to be constructed of noncombustible materials, but these materials don’t have to have a rated fire resistance in their assembly. In other words, you have to use noncombustible materials, but you don’t have to follow the very strict lab-tested specific versions of those constructions.
Type III
Type III buildings are probably the most common type for a commercial building, where the exterior of the building are inflammable, but the ‘guts’ of the building are. Think of your typical older warehouse or small office building; concrete or brick exterior walls with wood structure and floors inside.

Type III-A - Protected Combustible
2 hour rated Exterior Walls
1 hour rated Structural Frame
1 hour rated Floor/Ceiling/Roof Protection

Type III-B - Unprotected Combustible
2 Hr. Exterior Walls
No fire resistance required for structural frame, floors, ceilings, or roofs
Type IV
Type IV buildings are mostly historic, for they are where the main structure is made of heavy wood timbers 8” or larger. It’s extremely unlikely for a modern building to fall into this classification, but some older factories and warehouses do.

Type IV - Heavy Timber
2 hour rated Exterior Walls 
Type V
Type V buildings are mostly wood, with two subclasses, one where some of the building is fire rated, and the other where nothing much is. Most modern houses, smaller apartment buildings, and some smaller commercial buildings fall into this category.  

Type V-A - Protected wood frame
1 hour rated Exterior Walls
1 hour rated Structural Frame
1 hour rated Floor/Ceiling/Roof 
No raw exposed wood

Type V-B - Unprotected wood frame
No real limits, exposed wood and no fire rated construction.
Construction Limits
As was stated at the beginning of this section, there are limits on how big of a building or space of a particular occupancy based upon its Construction Type. Here is the chart that denotes this, as as you can see, some Occupancies (like Assembly) are very limited, where others (like small residences) are pretty unlimited.

<insert chart>
Additional Fire Rated Constructions
So while the Construction Types set the overall requirements for what has to be fire rated parts of the building, there are other rules that also trigger additional rated elements. These are too numerous to list, but we’ll cover the big ones you’re likely to encounter.

Separations between certain Occupancies are required. For example, no rated separations are required between an Business occupancy and a F-1 light manufacturing one. But an Assembly occupancy has to be separated from a Business occupancy with two-hour rated construction. In some cases, certain occupancies aren’t even allowed to be connected at all, and have to be completely separate. Like a Residential use being combined with a Hazardous use. Below is the chart that shows all of the variations and what has to be separated from what and how. Note that in many cases, having fire sprinklers makes the Rating requirements much lower (that’s what the ‘S’ vs ‘NS’ at the top of the chart is for).
